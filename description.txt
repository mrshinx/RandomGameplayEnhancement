Random Gameplay Enhancement is just a silly mod that aims to deliver new gameplay experience:

- Screenshake on hit
- Screenshake on kill
- Enemies flashing when hit
- Enemy combat quote
- Changing camera zoom depending on what player is doing. (Actually inspired by the awesome DvlUP's [url=store.steampowered.com] Auto Cam [/url] mod but since it's not ported to 1.4.4 yet I decided to make a worse version)

These features are all configurable.
Have fun
